Create a .github.io GitHub repository. This is the repository that will contain the fully rendered version of your Hugo website.  git clone \u0026lt;YOUR-PROJECT-URL\u0026gt; \u0026amp;\u0026amp; cd \u0026lt;YOUR-PROJECT\u0026gt; Paste your existing Hugo project into the new local repository. Make sure your website works locally (hugo server or hugo server -t ) and open your browser to http://localhost:1313. Once you are happy with the results: Press Ctrl+C to kill the server Before proceeding run rm -rf public to completely remove the public directory\ngit submodule add -b master https://github.com/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;USERNAME\u0026gt;.github.io.git public. This creates a git submodule. Now when you run the hugo command to build your site to public, the created public directory will have a different remote origin (i.e. hosted GitHub repository). Make sure the baseURL in your config file is updated with: .github.io Put it Into a Script\nYou’re almost done. In order to automate next steps create a deploy.sh script. You can also make it executable with chmod +x deploy.sh. The following are the contents of the deploy.sh script:\n#!/bin/sh # If a command fails then the deploy stops set -e printf \u0026quot;\\033[0;32mDeploying updates to GitHub...\\033[0m\\n\u0026quot; # Build the project. hugo # if using a theme, replace with `hugo -t \u0026lt;YOURTHEME\u0026gt;` # Go To Public folder cd public # Add changes to git. git add . # Commit changes. msg=\u0026quot;rebuilding site $(date)\u0026quot; if [ -n \u0026quot;$*\u0026quot; ]; then msg=\u0026quot;$*\u0026quot; fi git commit -m \u0026quot;$msg\u0026quot; # Push source and build repos. git push origin master You can then run ./deploy.sh \u0026ldquo;Your optional commit message\u0026rdquo; to send changes to .github.io. Note that you likely will want to commit changes to your repository as well. That’s it! Your personal page should be up and running at https://.github.io within a couple minutes.\n"

Let\u0026rsquo;s check the website : At the end of the webpage we can see a Copyright : After googling CuteNews, we can see that there is a CMS for news feed. Let\u0026rsquo;s check if there is any exploit on it : After checking the exploit, we can see that is pointing to a specific path :\n{ip}/CuteNews/cdata/users/lines Let\u0026rsquo;s check if we can access to the CuteNews folder : admin/admin don\u0026rsquo;t work, but we can register an account. We can access to the pannel but we can\u0026rsquo;t do nothing on it.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s check if the finded exploit can open us a door : We can get a shell from the machine : Let\u0026rsquo;s make a webshell and upload it :\ncp /usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php ~/boxes/passage ---\u0026gt; Modify the IP Let\u0026rsquo;s check if we can access to the upload dir and run the reverse shell : Now, we need to enumerate the accessible file to see if we have any password for an user. After some hours of enumeration, i find some file interresting : cat lines On the last file \u0026ldquo;lines\u0026rdquo;, the hash seems to be a base64, let\u0026rsquo;s try to decrypt it :\necho 'base64 string' | base64 -d We find a password in the LINES file :  NB : To check the hash type or decrypt it, you can use CyberChef website. There is a nice online tool.  Now we will try to find what\u0026rsquo;s is the type of hash with CyberChef :  It seems to be a SHA256 hash.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s try to decrypt all base64 line in this file, and decrypt the \u0026ldquo;pass\u0026rdquo; with SHA256 Decrypter  Not able to decrypt the admin pass (NADAV)\n For Paul User (where is present on the machine /home/) Account found ------- Username : paul Password : atlanta1 Now, we got creds and we can try to login into ssh on the machine.\n Access denied by ssh because of public key.\n OK. No problem. We know that we have an access with the python exploit \u0026ldquo;CuteNews\u0026rdquo;. We could try to execute the exploit again, \u0026ldquo;su paul\u0026rdquo;, enter the password and see what happend.\n BINGO ! We are logged in with paul user.\n Let\u0026rsquo;s implement SSH public key to the authorized_keys file to get a full shell to the machine.  Mmmh\u0026hellip; Strange, we already have a public SSH key for Nadav user who is the admin. Will take a look on it later.\n Generate a SSH key : ssh-keygen -t rsa Let\u0026rsquo;s try to SSH on 10.10.10.206 :  Well ! Take the user.txt hash and go ahead ! Let\u0026rsquo;s check for SSH key of Nadav.\n  Too simple to get the admin account. We can see that this user is a member of many groups. Let\u0026rsquo;s enumerate !\n Enumerate the process --------------------- ps -aux After some googling for USBCREATOR privilege escalation, i find this : Try the command :\ngdbus call --system --dest com.ubuntu.USBCreator --object-path /com/ubuntu/USBCreator --method com.ubuntu.USBCreator.Image /root/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/pwn true This is the end of this box.
